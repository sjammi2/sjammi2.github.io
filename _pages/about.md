Hey :) I'm Shreyas Jammi. I finished up my undergraduate studies in Engineering Physics at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign where I was involved in numerical relativity, scientific computing, and hardware accelerator research with the Illini Relativity Group. 

I am always looking for new projects to work on, so feel free to email me with any ideas you may have!
